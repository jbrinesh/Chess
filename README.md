## Overview

Chess is a full-stack single player game designed to showcase object oriented
programing using Ruby. The backend API is built on Rails and handles all of the
game logic. Requests can be made from the JavaScript user interface for the
current state of the board, to get valid moves, or to make a move. The server
always response with a complete board to act as a single source of truth.   

## Major Design Points

### Game tracking using session tokens

### Database Schema  

### Use of Muti-class hierarchy and inheritance to keep code DRY

### AI player Using Game Theory (coming soon)
